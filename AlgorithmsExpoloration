### The Pyraminx
<p> Placement: Can be solved <br>
Method/s Used: <br>
  - Top First Method <br>
  - Layer by Layer <br>
  
#### Records for the Pyraminx
Top First Method -<br>
  avg of 5
    current: 41.32 (σ = 14.45)
    best: 35.30 (σ = 5.71) <br>
  avg of 12
    current: 40.88 (σ = 13.70)
    best: 40.88 (σ = 13.70) <br>
 <br>
 Issue/s -<br>
 One of the major issue I go through is getting **confused** when getting to certain sides that messes up the cube (a little bit) that consequences to longer solving time. <br>
 <br>
 Next Step/s -<br>
 - get used to solving the pyraminx with the timer
 - more comfortable seeing different types of colours for easy solving
 - learn a new and faster algorithm
