        <h1 id="title">*** Why you should visit Japan ***</h1>
        
       <p> 
            Japan is full of <strong>interesting</strong> things. If you ask me what I like the most in Japan is its scenery <em>(especially its sakura trees) </em>and <strong>anime</strong>.
        </p>

        <p> The picture shown above is <em>Mt. Fuji</em>. A famous volcano located in Japan shown during spring time.</p>

        <p> Japan is made up of <em>hundreds</em> of islands. These islands are all seperated and grouped into 4:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Hokkaido
            <li>Honshu
            <li>Shikoku
            <li>Kyushu
        </ol>

        <p> Japan also consists of 4 seasons just like in Canada - spring, summer, fall, winter. Which is very beneficial and quite exiting if you ask me!<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        One of the most interesting events that happen in Japan during a short period of time during their spring season that occurs during mid-March to early-May are their <strong> sakura trees </strong> just like the picture shown above!
        </p>
        
        <p> There are a lot of things I still want to talk about on why you should defenitely visit Japan but I hope I convinced you a little!</p>
