            I spent lots of time with family today. I actually had to re-write this entry because it got deleted and I don't really know how to reverse this through Khan Academy.<br>

            Anyways, yesterday, I spent lots of time with family, especially with my dad since I don't live with him. He just bought me my Christmas gift actually. Christmas was like 2 months ago. I still appriciate it though. One of the best weekend probably. <br>
            <br>
            I have school tomorrow and I don't really know what to expect. It's Valentines Day. I'm not in any kind of romantic relationship and I don't plan to be in one soon. I have dreams and responsibilities to pursue!

            Currently at my CS class. I don't really know what to expect today. I just can't wait to finish this day and play games at home. I haven't been playing games lately. Especially with my (online) friends. <br>
            <br>
            CS class could be lowkey fun though. Even if were just doing modules. The teacher's cool. He's really fond of rubiks cubes. I remember when I was trying to learn the 6 by 6 cube, I wouldn't go to sleep until I could figure or memorize an algorithim. I took me atleast 3 months to memorize and to solve the cube without any help. I'm not as good as the one who solve it fast but I know how to. <br>
            <br>
            Anyways, If I come back to this I might do another entry and explain how this day went. <br>
