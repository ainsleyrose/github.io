### [Travel Webpage](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index.html)

```markdown
This was one of the project that got me started in my coding challenges. 
I learned a lot of new properties in this introduction project that I can apply as I go on my new provided challenges. 

Aspects that made a big impact in my learning process are adding different text sizes, adding the `<head></head>` function 
to add colours and fonts, and `<body></body>` function to add texts and `<src="">` for adding images from available sources 
to also changing their sizes.

Difficulty Level: 1/10
```

### [Recipe Book](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index2.html)

```markdown
Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as `<head></head>`, `<style></style>`, `<body></body>`.

New learning Concept/s:
Adding links within the project. `<a href=""></a>`. This function helps me direct to where I want to get a specific space in 
the website.
Sources at the end of the page was also added for more information provided to another link.

Difficulty Level: 3/10
```

### [Blog](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index3.html)

```markdown
Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as `<head></head>`, `<style></style>`, `<body></body>`.

This project was almost identical from the previous project only in different design and more writing was required.
"Getting this done" mentality was used for this project for completion.

Difficulty Level: 2/10
```

[**BLOG BASE CODE** - click me](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/commit/da881690660221a479259c42445d831d48f5aa3a)

### [Event Invite](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index4.html)

```markdown
Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as `<head></head>`, `<style></style>`, `<body></body>`.

This project is probably one of my favourites. I think I did this to my desired product. I overall had fun completing this 
project. I have put time and effort in this particular project.

New Learning Concept/s:
`<div></div>` was newly learned and used in this project to create the RSVP making shapes to make it identical through an actual 
RSVP where you can actually put things in.

Moving on...
Hopefully during my CS coding journey, I would learn how to actually code RSVP's where people can actually put things in.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

### [What's For Dinner?](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index5.javascript)

```markdown
Base code is only presented in this project.

Starting this project was a little challenge for me. "Getting this done" mentality was again used in this particular project in 
order for me to move on and learn for upcoming projects. Artistic thinking and design was required for this project and 
unfortunately this is not suited for me. I made this project the opportunity to learn how each coding concept works. 

New Learning Concept/s:
Creating different shapes using `fill()`, `rect()`, and `ellipse`.

Difficulty Level: 8/10
```
