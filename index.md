### [Travel Webpage](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index.html)

```markdown
This was one of the project that got me started in my coding challenges. 
I learned a lot of new properties in this introduction project that I can apply as I go on my new provided challenges. 

Aspects that made a big impact in my learning process are adding different text sizes, adding the `<head></head>` function 
to add colours and fonts, and `<body></body>` function to add texts and `<src="">` for adding images from available sources 
to also changing their sizes.

Difficulty Level: 1/10
```

### [Recipe Book](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index2.html)

```markdown
Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as `<head></head>`, `<style></style>`, `<body></body>`.

New learning Concept:
Adding links within the project. `<a href=""></a>`. This function helps me direct to where I want to get a specific space in 
the website.

Difficulty Level: 2/10
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
