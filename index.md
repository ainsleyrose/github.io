This is one of the projects that got me started in my coding challenges. I learned a lot of new properties in this 
introduction project that I can apply as I go on my new provided challenges.

Aspects that made a big impact in my learning process are adding different text sizes, adding the ```<head></head>```  function to add colours and fonts, and ```<body></body>``` function to add texts and ```<src="">``` for adding images from available sources to also changing their sizes.

Difficulty Level: 1/10

### [Recipe Book](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index2.html)

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

New learning Concept/s:
Adding links within the project. ```<a href=""></a>``` to ```<id="">```. This function helps the producers direct automatically to where they want to specificly land on within the website through the table of contents provided at the top of every webpage.

Sources functions were also used at the end of the page to provide more information bringing them to another link.

Difficulty Level: 3/10

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

This project was almost identical from the previous project only in different design and more writing was required. "Getting this done" mentality was used for this project for completion.

Difficulty Level: 2/10

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

This project is probably one of my favourites. I think I did this to my desired product. I overall had fun completing this project. I have put time and effort in this particular project.

New Learning Concept/s:
```<div></div>``` was newly learned and used in this project to create the RSVP making shapes to make it identical through an actual RSVP where you can actually put things in.

Moving on...
Hopefully during my CS coding journey, I would learn how to actually code RSVP's where people can actually put things in.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

### [What's For Dinner?](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/blob/main/index5.javascript)

![img](https://c.tenor.com/liCayjQo6YsAAAAC/lunch-licking-lips.gif)

Base code is only presented in this project.

Starting this project was a little challenge for me. "Getting this done" mentality was again used in this particular project in order for me to move on and learn for upcoming projects. Artistic thinking and design was required for this project and unfortunately this is not suited for me. I made this project the opportunity to learn how each coding concept works. 

New Learning Concept/s:
Creating different shapes using ```fill()```, ```rect()```, and ```ellipse```.

Difficulty Level: 8/10

### [Algorithm Exploration - Pyraminx Record](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/tree/Algorithms-Exploration-HTML-projs#readme)

![img](https://c.tenor.com/r4XdNJXJaiYAAAAM/axolote.gif)

During the modules presented before this, we were given a pyraminx to figure out how to solve it in the most efficient way. For this assignment, the teacher gave us a mixed up pyraminx and sat us down with a couple students and timed how fast we can solve the pyraminx and collected our medians between 5 sets of solving the pyraminx.

Difficulty Level: 1.5/10

### [Live Creative Coding Challenge - group](https://editor.p5js.org/hwarn1/sketches/WbSDbRg0U)

![img](https://c.tenor.com/v4aEu8aaNTkAAAAM/partners-natalie-williams.gif)

This is one of my favourite group work that I have done with other people. Although only me and Hadley did it, I think this was a success. 

I have learned several new concepts in this project, it boosted my knowledge by someone explaining the code and trying to refactor it to make it more interesting. Teaching the code to the class also made me more understand the base code even more.

Difficulty Level: 8/10

### [HackED](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TLIfjdqSlH51wjZor2eyubJb2vBfvrUQMy60olOFt2s/edit#slide=id.gb77f0cf075_0_0)

Another group project. We created a game representing on how to make the world a better place. It's fun talking to groupmates on how to create and make it look pretty. Communicating with peers can be really important when it comes to computer science. It's the only way to gather information and make it better. 

I mostly only contributed my thoughts and just followed through the code and tried to refactor it but the team decided to not add my refactored code into the final product because it wasn't that good lol. (I tried!)

Overall, I think teamwork had the most impact on me on this assignment.

### Git'n Going

![img](https://c.tenor.com/A15H8E1VUh8AAAAM/github-cat.gif)

In this activity, I was given tutorials on how to use GitHub. It kick-started me to use Github. To express my learning through this activity, is this website!

I learned how to code on Github and how to work through issues with my group and share information. It gets a little tricky sometimes but it's a learning process! Next learning steps would be trying to make websites more professional (maybe adding the visual presentation of each project in the webpage instead of bringing the viewer into a different website, adding button functions to bring them into the different parts of the page).

Difficulty level: 9/10

### AYJ: Game Jam

We were assigned finish the lessons on Khan Academy with game development (Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations) in order to create a new simple game just to show our learning stages. I started to create a proposal and thought about making a **"guessing a number game"**. I learned a lot in this project. I took information from the lessons provided in Khan Academy and also from the internet(Google). Some bugs were present. I had trouble in completing the "button" action. There was a bug somewhere so it took me approximately 5 hours to complete this project. Apparently it was just a typo completing the function.

I would say that this is the hardest project I had to do because I completed it on my own but also the most fun in my opinion! Being able to complete a simple game with basic concepts is one step forward. For my next steps, I would try to expand my learning on how to use these concept for future projects (JS, HTML, CSS).

Dificulty level: 10/10

### ~ Overall comments ~

I have learned several concepts introducing me to HTML/CSS for web design and Javascript for inside concepts. Starting this course, I intro'ed my learning in Khan Academy and applied these learning to help my peers in group projects to make our assignment even more creative for us to present. 

In my opinion, my portfolio isn't the most desired as I haven't really been doing all the completed assignments assigned in Khan Academy to complete the knowledge to start certain addignments. Although, I tried my best. I created little projects during learning, converted them into real accessible websites for my peers to see from my portfolio, learned how to work through GitHub, publishing a website, coding it, designing it, and finally submit the final product ... all by myself. All through my ICS3U class, I haven't asked for any help from my teacher and was basically learning and searching for answers in the internet. Sometimes I would also ask my peers for their help and their opinions. 

But, I am proud. I never thought I would be able to learn how to publish a website. My next steps would be, learning how to be better and apply these learning for future purposes. Especially web design and it's insides works.
