### [Travel Webpage](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index.html)

This is one of the projects that got me started in my coding challenges. I learned a lot of new properties in this 
introduction project that I can apply as I go on my new provided challenges.

Aspects that made a big impact in my learning process are adding different text sizes, adding the ```<head></head>```  function to add colours and fonts, and ```<body></body>``` function to add texts and ```<src="">``` for adding images from available sources to also changing their sizes.

Difficulty Level: 1/10

[**TRAVEL WEBPAGE BASE CODE** - click me](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/commit/6d4ba7d9227e615f1a27a539a39a5bdf5c057771)

### [Recipe Book](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index2.html)

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

New learning Concept/s:
Adding links within the project. ```<a href=""></a>``` to ```<id="">```. This function helps the producers direct automatically to where they want to specificly land on within the website through the table of contents provided at the top of every webpage.

Sources functions were also used at the end of the page to provide more information bringing them to another link.

Difficulty Level: 3/10

### [Blog](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index3.html)

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

This project was almost identical from the previous project only in different design and more writing was required. "Getting this done" mentality was used for this project for completion.

Difficulty Level: 2/10

[**BLOG BASE CODE** - click me](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/commit/da881690660221a479259c42445d831d48f5aa3a)

### [Event Invite](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/a8e4b09ce2837d8449c4bb2f327bf3f6a9c37197/index4.html)

Same coding properties/functions were used from the last project; such as ```<head></head>```, ```<style></style>```, ```<body></body>```.

This project is probably one of my favourites. I think I did this to my desired product. I overall had fun completing this project. I have put time and effort in this particular project.

New Learning Concept/s:
```<div></div>``` was newly learned and used in this project to create the RSVP making shapes to make it identical through an actual RSVP where you can actually put things in.

Moving on...
Hopefully during my CS coding journey, I would learn how to actually code RSVP's where people can actually put things in.

Difficulty Level: 6/10

### [What's For Dinner?](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/blob/main/index5.javascript)

Base code is only presented in this project.

Starting this project was a little challenge for me. "Getting this done" mentality was again used in this particular project in order for me to move on and learn for upcoming projects. Artistic thinking and design was required for this project and unfortunately this is not suited for me. I made this project the opportunity to learn how each coding concept works. 

New Learning Concept/s:
Creating different shapes using ```fill()```, ```rect()```, and ```ellipse```.

Difficulty Level: 8/10

### [Algorithm Exploration - Pyraminx Record](https://github.com/ainsleyrose/HTML-CSS-JS-Projects/tree/Algorithms-Exploration-HTML-projs#readme)

During the modules presented before this, we were given a pyraminx to figure out how to solve it in the most efficient way. For this assignment, the teacher gave us a mixed up pyraminx and sat us down with a couple students and timed how fast we can solve the pyraminx and collected our medians between 5 sets of solving the pyraminx.

Difficulty Level: 1.5/10

### [Live Creative Coding Challenge - group](https://editor.p5js.org/hwarn1/sketches/WbSDbRg0U)
This is one of my favourite group work that I have done with other people. Although only me and Hadley did it, I think this was a success. 

I have learned several new concepts in this project, it boosted my knowledge by someone explaining the code and trying to refactor it to make it more interesting. Teaching the code to the class also made me more understand the base code even more.

Difficulty Level: 8/10

### [HackED](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TLIfjdqSlH51wjZor2eyubJb2vBfvrUQMy60olOFt2s/edit#slide=id.gb77f0cf075_0_0)

Another group project. We created a game representing on how to make the world a better place. It's fun talking to groupmates on how to create and make it look pretty. Communicating with peers can be really important when it comes to computer science. It's the only way to gather information and make it better. 

I mostly only contributed my thoughts and just followed through the code and tried to refactor it but the team decided to not add my refactored code into the final product because it wasn't that good lol. (I tried!)

Overall, I think teamwork had the most impact on me on this assignment.

### Git'n Going

In this activity, I was given tutorials on how to use GitHub. It kick-started me to use Github. To express my learning through this activity, is this website!

I learned how to code on Github and how to work through issues with my group and share information. It gets a little tricky sometimes but it's a learning process!

Difficulty level: 9/10

### Microbit

Did not contributed in this project and teacher gave me the permission to be passed in this assignment.\
